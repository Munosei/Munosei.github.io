# 🏝️ My Animal Crossing Portfolio

Welcome to my little digital island! 🌿✨ This is a cozy, Animal Crossing-inspired portfolio where I showcase my work, projects, and creativity in a warm and welcoming space. Just like in *Animal Crossing*, everything here is designed with a touch of charm and simplicity.

## 🎨 Features
- 🌸 **Whimsical Animal Crossing Aesthetic** – Soft pastels, rounded corners, and a friendly atmosphere.
- 🏡 **Sections for Everything** – About Me, Projects, and Contact, all wrapped up in a cozy UI.
- 🎮 **Dynamic and Minimalist** – A simple but delightful way to showcase creativity.

## 🌊 Getting Started
To explore this island-themed portfolio, open the `index.html` file in your browser. Make sure the background image and music file are in the same directory, it's just the backbone though but it will be updated from time to time!

## 🎉 Enjoy Your Stay!
Just like in *Animal Crossing*, this portfolio is meant to be a place of creativity, self-expression, and fun. So take a stroll, look around, and enjoy the vibes! 🌼💖

Happy coding! 🎮🏡
